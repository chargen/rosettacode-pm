GitRosettaCode is a project to attempt to make it easy to fetch and run code
examples from the RosettaCode website (http://rosettacode.org).

RosettaCode is a programming chrestomathy wiki that has a matrix of ~650
programming task vs ~500 programming languages, with user contributed code
examples for many of the combinations.

Running example code usually involves copy/pasting from the website to some
format that the language expects to find source code in. The copy process often
adds undesired whitespace to the code. After you get the code in the right
place you need to figure out how to use the language with the code.

The idea of this project is to simplify things as much as possible, by:

* Having the code live in a GitHub repository (synced to rosettacode.org)
* Having automation (ie Makefiles and .bat files) to build and run the code
* Having automation and/or instructions for installing languages/runtimes

Having things on GitHub will also allow for Pull Request contributions.
